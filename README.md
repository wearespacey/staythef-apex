<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Due to the global pandemic of COVID-19 in 2020, the Space Office hackathon was cancelled and replaced by an new and fully remote hackathon : the Stay the f\*\*\* at home Hackathon.

We decided to work on a webapp gathering owners of 3D printers with creator of 3D models to allow them to share their resources with anyone in need, while sharing the profits with a charity chosen by the buyer.

We thus created **Staythef\*\*\*apex**, a React typsescript online shop that shares the sales profit between the creator of the 3D model, the owner of the 3D printer and a charity chosen by the buyer.

### Built With
